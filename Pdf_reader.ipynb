The charity is a company\\nlimited by guarantee and not having a share capital, as defined by the Companies Act 2006. Trustees are elected by the\\nboard and the members at the AGM. All trustees have an existing or future interest in the aims and activities of the\\ncharity. New trustees receive an induction pack and all trustees review the activities of the charity. The trustees meet\\n3-4 times a year and decisions are made at those meetings. The trustees regularly review the risks to which the charity is\\nexposed and procedures are in force to manage those risks.\\nRisk management\\nThe trustees have a duty to identify and review the risks to which the charity is exposed and to ensure appropriate\\ncontrols are in place to provide reasonable assurance against fraud and error.\\n\\nPage 1\\n\\n\\x0cBlackwell Sailing\\nReport of the Trustees\\nfor the Year Ended 31 March 2016\\nOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES\\nObjectives and aims\\nThe objects of Blackwell Sailing as set out in the Governing Document are:\\n\" to provide sailing and other outdoor activities for people with disabilities\\n\" to provide appropriate support and facilities for this\\n\" to promote participation on equal terms by encouraging independence\\n\" to carry out other charitable purposes to improve the condition of life of such persons as the trustees may determine\\nTo this end the charity raises funds, organises and facilitates evening and daytime sailing sessions on Windermere\\n(April-October) with volunteer support and under the supervision of a qualified RYA Senior Sailing Instructor. The\\ncharity also provides opportunities for sailing members to pursue other outdoor activities such as canoeing, camping\\nand walking (through the winter months). All activities are supported by volunteers. Approximately 35 volunteers are\\ninvolved in various roles, including the abovementioned, boat maintenance and fundraising. Their contribution is\\nessential to the running of the charity.\\n\\nPage 2\\n\\n\\x0cBlackwell Sailing\\nReport of the Trustees\\nfor the Year Ended 31 March 2016\\nACHIEVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE\\nCharitable activities\\nThe Charity continues to employ Manager and Principal Instructor, David Hall, who works full time for the charity and\\nalso acts as Company Secretary. We now have a team of 5 Senior RYA Sailing Instructors involved, 3 RYA Instructors\\nand 19 RYA Assistant Instructors in a team of 45 volunteers. Following further powerboat training 28 of our volunteers\\nhave now achieved their RYA Safety Boat certificate. One of our senior instructors is also an RYA Powerboat\\nInstructor so we can do this training at our own sailing base.\\nMaintenance work continued on the boats over the winter months thanks to the practical skills of our volunteer\\nmaintenance team which includes one of our sailing members, Colin Jackson (who has learning disabilities) and attends\\nevery week throughout the winter . We have been given support from Lakeland Disability Support for some new sailing\\nkit and another donation, received from Windermere Rotary has covered the cost of some new jib sails and a new winch\\nfor lifting people in and out of boats. A generous donation was received from Mark Hancock to cover the 2016\\ntransport costs for our group of sailors with visual impairments. We have covered the cost of having professional\\nrepairs done to the safety boat from our unrestricted funds.\\nThe winter walking group continued with regular weekly walks led by volunteers from November to March. The group\\nhave been constant throughout the winter months, have gained or maintained a good level of fitness and were again\\nawarded with certificates at the end of the season with their total miles walked. A total of 12 people benefitted.\\nThe total number of beneficiaries last season was 189. Of those, 74 attended regularly and 65 were under 18 years old.\\nWe ran a total of 102 sailing sessions. We welcomed the local groups as usual which included some newcomers from\\nBeaumont College, Carlisle and some individuals who came for taster sessions or attended regularly on Tuesday\\nevenings. On several occasions we loaned our boats to local charity, Bendrigg Trust, for them to run sailing sessions\\nfrom the public jetties close by at Ferry Nab.\\nDuring the 2015 season we were able to organise participation in the RNLI Open Handicap race in July and entered 4\\nboats. Two of the boats finished within the first 10 of a fleet of about 40 boats. In September a group of 6 sailing\\nmembers with severe learning disabilities spent a week at the Calvert Trust Outdoor Centre in the North Lakes taking\\npart in a wide range of activities which included sailing, walking, cycling and exploring a disused copper mine. The\\nparticipants all contributed to costs but we provided volunteer support and some essential top-up funding.\\nOur cupboard of indoor educational resources now has a jigsaw, worksheets, a board game, picture dominoes, drawing\\nmaterials and a game of sailing bingo to make it possible for groups to be kept occupied and to learn relevant skills\\nduring extreme weather conditions. We have plans to make more games and work sheets in the future and also intend to\\nadd to our collection of video clips, which can be used for both entertainment and training purposes.\\nAs well as the sail training we were able to provide some RYA Powerboat and Safety Boat training and some on-shore\\ntraining, which included RYA 1st Aid and the RYAS Disability Awareness course. Also during the winter months, we\\nheld an Instructors Day to enable the Senior Instructors to spend a day highlighting issues and to plan for the future. It\\nwas decided to compile a new questionnaire for volunteers in order to gather information about what they were\\nprepared to do and where their training priorities lay. We have also negotiated for the RYA Safeguarding of Children\\nand Vulnerable Adults workshop to be held locally and then attended as part of the up-dating process for our own\\nSafeguarding Policy.\\nThe charity continued to fund sailing sessions run by freelance instructors: Mel Vause, John Brain, Tony Longworth\\nand Linnhe Harrison. They are all qualified RYA Senior Instructors and John is also an RYA Coach/Assessor and\\nInspector. Most of the funding for the manager\\'s salary, freelance instructor fees, training and other core costs was\\nprovided again by Northern Rock Foundation and Sir John Fisher Foundation. We received further funding for the\\ncharity\\'s core costs from Lloyds Bank Foundation and Frieda Scott Charitable Trust. Some funding for last sailing\\nseason was also given by Lakeland Disability Support, the Rothera Family Charity Trust and The Hadfield Trust. Our\\ninsurance and some other running costs have increased slightly but we receive much support from our landlords and\\nbenefactors, Harold and Janet Lefton who have continued to give us the use of this excellent site, fuel for the workshop\\nand also electricity. We receive small donations from our sailing members each time they come sailing and we now ask\\nfor \\xc2\\xa35 per head for each sailing session.\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\n\\x0cBlackwell Sailing\\nReport of the Trustees\\nfor the Year Ended 31 March 2016\\nACHIEVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE\\nCharitable activities\\nJoyce Manning, trustee and sailing member, who is blind, continues to assist in the office for a half day each week.\\nWhen Joyce is not available to come, we have encouraged another sailing member, Thor Briody, to come instead and\\nassist as part of the day service work experience initiative. During the winter months the volunteers and another sailing\\nmember who has a learning disability, Colin Jackson, worked to clean and maintain all the boats in our workshop for\\nthe new season.\\nThe charity maintains good working relationships with the main disability groups in the area: Cumbria Care, The\\nOaklea Trust, Sight Advice, Leonard Cheshire, Beaumont College and the abovementioned schools and day centres.\\nWe continue to receive much-valued support from Bendrigg Trust and RYA Sailability, who again awarded us Centre\\nof Excellence status for the coming season. We have benefited, as before, from the continuing support of parents, carers\\nand the friends of sailing members who are encouraged to attend our activities, open days and social events and to\\nbecome volunteers.\\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\\nReserves policy\\nWe aim to have between 9 and 12 months funding in reserve. If reserves fall below 6 months (approximately \\xc2\\xa337,000)\\nwe will call a meeting to formulate in a strategy to raise additional funds and make good the shortfall.\\nBlackwell Sailing had an income of \\xc2\\xa366,200 and expenses of \\xc2\\xa359,520\\nWith reserves brought forward from 2015/16 we now have a total of \\xc2\\xa346,682 to take forward for the 2016/17 financial\\nyear.\\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\\nAs we approach the new financial year we are very grateful to Sir John Fisher Foundation for giving us a larger grant\\nthan previously given and also to Frieda Scott Charitable Trust for awarding us a 3 year grant. We are waiting to hear\\nfrom two other trusts regarding grant applications and hope that we can receive support at a similar or higher level than\\nthat received from Northern Rock Foundation. We will continue to tap into the support we can find locally and raise\\nsome funding ourselves through local groups and sponsored events. We will keep our website up to date and encourage\\nmore support for the charity through the local media and by encouraging on-line donations through Virgin Money\\nGiving, with Gift Aid being added automatically.\\nWe intend to continue our activities as before - including a residential activity week at Plas Menai Sailing and Activity\\nCentre in September, a sailing/camping weekend for the group with visual impairments and a Flotilla Day in August.\\nVolunteer training will continue and include the Disability Awareness Training, 1st Aid as well as further sailing and\\npowerboat training. We are also planning to offer, during the 2016 season, the opportunity of an \"away day\" for\\nvolunteer training on Ullswater with Glenridding Sailing Centre.\\nWe will continue to encourage our sailing members to extend their outdoor experiences, to include other activities (e.g.\\ntall ship sailing) and to progress, where appropriate, to sail different boats at different locations. When funding allows\\nwe will also offer canoeing sessions in order to provide a variety of experiences here on Windermere. We will continue\\nto focus on the quality of our teaching and the development of educational resources (for use both on and off the water).\\nWork has already started on the writing of our own training manual, which will be a useful reference for both\\nvolunteers and visitors who come to sail our traditional lug-rigged boats.\\nThe charity will continue to operate on a non-commercial basis working with volunteers and maintaining partnerships\\nwith other local groups. The charity will be needs-led and client-centred in its approach and make improvements and\\nspecial adaptations to boats and equipment when necessary. At the start of the 2016 season we have had enquiries from\\ntwo new groups who have booked for \"taster\" sessions with a view to booking regular sessions after that if the sailing is\\npopular.\\nAfter a year of waiting (for its development) we will now receive a new sailing boat for the 2016 season. Funded by\\nSteve Hague and the Will Clark Fund, the boat will be suitable for Will Clark, Steve Hague and others to sail. It will\\nhave both electric/manual controls and have the capacity to take up to 4 people.\\n\\nPage 4\\n\\n\\x0cBlackwell Sailing\\nReport of the Trustees\\nfor the Year Ended 31 March 2016\\nApproved by order of the board of trustees on ............................................. and signed on its behalf by:\\n\\n.............................................\\nG A Pardoe - Trustee\\n\\nPage 5\\n\\n\\x0cIndependent Examiner\\'s Report to the Trustees of\\nBlackwell Sailing\\nI report on the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 set out on pages seven to fourteen.\\nRespective responsibilities of trustees and examiner\\nThe charity\\'s trustees (who are also the directors for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of\\nthe accounts.
