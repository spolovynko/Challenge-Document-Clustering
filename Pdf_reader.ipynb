The\\ncharity is governed by a Board of Trustees, of whom there shall never be less than three, and the\\nmaximum number shall be eighteen. The Trustees meet quarterly for the Board of Trustees meeting,\\nand for the Annual General Meeting (AGM), at which the audited accounts for the year are formally\\napproved. At the AGM one third of the Trustees retire, and are eligible for re-election as long as they\\nhave not served for a continuous period exceeding six years. After six years Trustees must retire.\\nMalaria\\n\\nNew trustees are recruited for their skills in areas relevant to the governance, aims or the changing\\nnature of strategy and activities of Malaria Consortium. The trustees may at any time select a suitable\\nperson as a trustee, either to fill a vacancy or by way of addition to their number, who should be\\nappointed in consultation with all existing trustees on the Board and preferably with unanimous\\nsupport for the appointment. Trustees are sought in a variety of ways involving exploration of the field\\nfrom those working for or with Malaria\\nof potential candidates, including by recommendation\\nConsortium, or from existing trustees. Potential trustees are scrutinised by the Officers of the Board of\\nTrustees and by the Board as a whole. All new trustees receive an induction to the organisation by the\\nChief Executive and may be invited to attend a Board Meeting prior to election.\\n\\nThere are three sub-committees of the Board, the Governance Committee, the Finance, Audit and Risk\\nCommittee and the Compensation Committee. The purpose of the Governance Committee is to\\nreview and make recommendations\\nregarding Board effectiveness, provide direction regarding ongoing Board development and lead the process of Board renewal. Currently, the Committee comprises\\nfive members including the Chief Executive who is a non-voting member of the Committee. The\\npurpose of the Finance, Audit and Risk Committee is to provide assurance to the Board that an\\neffective internal control and risk management system is maintained and that Malaria Consortium's\\nfinancial performance is being effectively managed. Currently, the Committee comprises six members,\\nincluding two non-trustee members, and the Chief Executive and Chief Finance Officer as non-voting\\nmembers. The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to review and make recommendations on\\nthe Chief Executive's remuneration, the framework for the Global Management Group's remuneration\\nand the organisation's human resources strategy and policies. Currently, the Committee comprises\\nfour trustee members, including the Chair of the Board of Trustees.\\nThe Board of Trustees approves the major strategic decisions for the organisation. Each year, a\\nnumber of trustees are invited to make field visits to be fully informed about Malaria Consortium's\\nactivities, thus enabling them to effectively support these strategic decisions. The Board of Trustees\\ndelegates day-to-day operational decision-making to the Chief Executive, who, with the Global\\nThe GMG is supported by Senior Management\\nManagement Group (GMG), runs the organisation.\\nTeams at regional and country level responsible for technical, management and finance, as well as\\nprojects and programmes.\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\nMalaria Consortium's\\n\\nhead office is in London, United Kingdom. The regional offices for Africa, based\\nKampala, Uganda and for Asia, based in Bangkok, Thailand coordinate and supervise programmes\\nand projects at country level in the two regions. The Country Director of Nigeria reports directly to the\\nChief Executive. Global activities and any work in other parts of the world are directed through the\\nhead office in the UK. During this reporting period, country offices in Africa were operating in\\nin\\n\\nKampala, Uganda; Juba, South Sudan; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Maputo, Mozambique; Mansa, Zambia;\\nand Abuja, Nigeria. Malaria Consortium has a project office in Accra, Ghana.

Staff in Nigeria also\\nsupport Yobe state from Jigawa, and have presence implementing programmes in 9 other states. The\\nUganda Malaria Research Centre continues its activities in Kampala. In Asia offices were operational in\\nBangkok and Chiang Mai in Thailand and Phnom Penh, Ratnakiri and Pailin in Cambodia as well as in\\nYangon, Myanmar. Our operations in Zambia came to the end of their funding cycle and were\\nsuspended, during the year, until alternative funding can be identified.\\n\\nthis year Malaria Consortium's partners who have supported our work at the global and\\nlevel include\\nthe Department\\nfor International\\nDevelopment/United\\nKingdom\\nAid\\n(DFID/UKAID), United States Agency for International\\nDevelopment and US President's Malaria\\nInitiative (USAID/PMI), Canadian International\\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), Bill Ik Melinda Gates\\nFoundation (BMGF), Comic Relief, Global Malaria Programme of the World Health Organisation\\n(WHO), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS/HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), Centers of Disease\\nControl and Prevention, USA (CDC), UNICEF, UNITAID, the World Food Program (WFP) and the United\\nNations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).\\nDuring\\n\\nregional\\n\\nAt country level, our partners include National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCP) and Ministries of\\nHealth (MOH); local and regional UN offices; regional organisations in West, East, and Southern Africa,\\n\\nbilateral donors; international\\n\\nsector and most importantly\\n\\nfoundations; civil society organisations; development projects, private\\ncommunities suffering from malaria and other communicable diseases.\\n\\nClose collaborations are maintained with academic institutions in UK including the Nuffield Centre for\\nInternational Health and Development at Leeds University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical\\nMedicine and University College, London; Johns Hopkins University in the USA; Makerere University,\\nUganda; Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana; the University of Nigeria;\\nEduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique; Mahidol University, Thailand; and Pasteur Institute,\\nCambodia.\\nMalaria Consortium is involved with the Roll Back Malaria Partnership globally and at country level. In\\nthe UK, we work with the All Party Parliamentary Group for Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases,\\nMalaria No More UK and others. We have a considerable amount of local advocacy partners in\\nendemic areas, working to advocate for change and an end to malaria and neglected tropical diseases.\\nIn Nigeria, we work with the Christian\\nHealth Association of Nigeria, the Federation of Muslim\\nWomen's Association of Nigeria, the Health Reform Foundation of Nigeria, the Centre for\\nCommunication\\nProgramme Nigeria and the Health Policy and Research centre of the University of\\nNigeria.

The directors of\\nMalaria Enterprise Limited are the Treasurer, the Chief Executive and Chief Finance Officer of Malaria\\nConsortium. Malaria Enterprise Limited was dormant during the year.\\nMalaria Consortium US Inc. was established in 2009 to further the aim and objectives of Malaria\\nConsortium in the United States of America. The directors of Malaria Consortium US Inc, are two extrustees of Malaria Consortium and are independent from the UK Board of Trustees. As Malaria\\nConsortium does not control the activities of Malaria Consortium US Inc. Malaria Consortium does not\\nconsolidate its results within these accounts.\\n\\nAim and Objectives\\nThe principal aim of Malaria Consortium is to prevent and relieve the suffering of some of the poorest\\ncommunities in the world caused mainly, though not exclusively, by malaria. We have referred to the\\nguidance in the Charity Commission's general guidance on Public Benefit when reviewing our aims and\\nobjectives and in planning our future activities.

Malaria Consortium has also been privileged to be the delivery partner for the\\nUgandan Government to achieve universal coverage of homes with long-lasting, insecticide-treated\\nnets (LLINs). A selection of key achievements over the year is presented below:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDevelop and implement improved approaches to delivery of prevention and case management\\nfor control of communicable diseases, especially malaria, childhood illnesses and neglected\\ntropical diseases (NTDsj\\n~\\nPrevention: Following acceptance by the World Health Organisation,\\nSeasonal Malaria\\nChemoprevention has been piloted in Northern Nigeria for 170,000 children under the age of 5\\nyears. This approach takes into account the seasonal nature of malaria in the Sahel and gives 34 doses of antimalarial medicines to children during the rainy season when transmission\\nincreases. Indications are that there has been 70M reduction in all cause presentation of fever\\nto the local clinics and a significant UNITAID funded programme to reach 7.2m children has\\nbeen approved. A significant improvement in Polio vaccination uptake was also noted as an\\nunexpected benefit.\\n~\\nAs noted above, we have been the lead partner for the Government of Uganda in the delivery of\\n20. Sm nets to achieve universal coverage of LLINs. During the reporting period, 11.4 million nets\\nwere delivered. The nets were donated by Global Fund for the benefit of the Government of\\nUganda for the distribution at a total value of E22, 426, 484.\\n~\\nDiagnosis: For malaria we secured funding to test novel approaches to private sector\\nengagement for Rapid Diagnostic tests and began roll out in Uganda and Nigeria. For\\npneumonia we developed an approach for testing a selection of new field diagnostic tools in\\nmultiple locations and won funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to deliver this\\n\\n~\\n\\nresearch.\\nIntegrated Community Case Management (ICCM): This approach for diarrhoea, pneumonia and\\nmalaria (and sometimes nutrition products (ICCM+)), complementary to facility-based services,\\nhas been demonstrated to be a significant contributor to the successful control of malaria, the\\nconsequent reduction in the number of severe cases, and a reduction in overall morbidity and\\nmortality. This has been particularly effective in remote, hard-to-access areas. Work on testing\\nand scaling-up the use of mHealth approaches in support of community health workers (CHWs),\\ncontinued in Uganda and Mozambique with resources in Uganda supported by Malaria\\nConsortium from our unrestricted funds and with support from DFID. We have continued our\\nICCM work in South Sudan with support from DFID, but we were unable to mobilise resources\\nto continue in northern Zambia. We have undertaken significant work supporting the Ministry\\nof Health in Nigeria to introduce ICCM, both through support to training and to strategy\\ndevelopment, including national guidelines.\\nOur ICCM work is conducted through the CIDAfunded WHO RAcE project, the US Government MAPS project and our strategic investment of\\nDFID funds.\\n\\n~\\n\\nMalaria in Pregnancy: we carried out an extensive assessment of the burden and challenges of\\nmalaria in pregnancy in Southeast Asia, which has fed into strategies for future action. In\\nUganda we have studied the reasons for low uptake of the second dose of intermittent\\npreventive therapy in pregnancy, and this will lead testing strategies to improve uptake.\\n\\n~\\n\\nNeglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs); Malaria Consortium won a competitive bid to deliver Mass\\nDrug Administration\\nfor relevant NTDs to 3-4 States in South Sudan. Just prior to finalising the\\ncontract the security situation in South Sudan deteriorated and implementation is suspended\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\nnotice. We are starting a programme on community dialogues for better NTD\\ncontrol in Mozambique.\\nResponse to drug and insecticide resistance: We continue to serve on the WHO Drug Resistance\\nContainment Technical Expert Group which is guiding global strategies on tackling the threat of\\nartemisinin resistance, and our work in the Greater Mekong Sub region to develop innovative\\nWe have undertaken a\\napproaches to elimination of artemisinin resistance is expanding.\\nsuccessful project in Cambodia setting up screening points on the borders of Vietnam, Laos and\\nThailand to detect and correctly treat infected cases, even when they have no symptoms and to\\ncontribute to mapping artemisinin resistance markers. We are providing technical support to\\nthe newly formed Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance, which includes a focus on regional\\napproaches to tackle resistance. In Zambia we completed a study on the role of community\\nhealth workers in supporting the rational use of antibiotics. We are also exploring insecticide\\nresistance management strategies in Uganda.\\nWe received donations of commodities from UNICEF in both Uganda and South Sudan with a\\ncombination therapies and\\nmarket value of f371,490 including albendazole, artemisinin-based\\nPlumpyNut~; in addition in South Sudan we receive other donated goods valued at E61,62S to\\nsupport our work within the community from Population Services International, World Food\\nuntil further\\n\\n~\\n\\n~\\n\\n~\\n\\nProgramme and ACF.\\nBehaviour change communications: several of our projects are looking at innovative approaches\\nFor instance, we have piloted an innovative positive deviance\\nto effective communication.\\napproach in order to increase health knowledge and improve attitudes and practice around\\nIn Mozambique\\nwe have used community\\nmalaria in high-risk communities in Myanmar.\\n(ICCM), and we are now exploring\\ndialogues for integrated community case management\\nsimilar methods for neglected tropical diseases.\\n\\n2. Engage in the elimination of malaria, lymphatic filariasis and other communicable diseases in a\\nrange of transmission settings using innovative strategies and approaches\\nMalaria Consortium is active in countries where there are a range of transmission rates of malaria and\\nother diseases, increasingly requiring a more tailored national, regional or sub-regional approach.\\nWhile many parts of Africa will not approach malaria elimination for several years, there are other\\nparts of Africa, and several countries in Asia, which are now setting their sights on elimination within\\nthe next 20 years, and Malaria Consortium is actively participating in that agenda. An important focus\\nof our work is on elimination of Plasmodium folciporum in the Greater Mekong Sub region, as an\\nresistance, without which the chances of malaria\\nessential strategy to eliminate artemisinin\\n\\nelimination\\n\\nare very slim.\\n\\nOur new IMMERSE project and its predecessor, supported by The Centers for Disease Control and\\nPresident's Malaria Initiative have included a range of activities, including tracking\\nPrevention/\\nartemisinin resistance (in collaboration with Pasteur Institute, Cambodia), testing the feasibility of a\\ndehydrogenase\\n(G6PD) deficiency, which could\\nnew rapid diagnostic test for glucose-6-phosphate\\nwith directly observed\\nallow for wider deployment of primaquine, roll-out of atovaquone-proguanil\\ntherapy in areas of artemisinin resistance, and designing an assessment of insecticide-treated clothing\\nto protect rubber tappers when they work outdoors at night time in Myanmar.\\nWe continued as an active member of Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) and\\n\\nformalised our membership.\\n\\nwe have undertaken research supported by the BMGF Malaria Elimination Scientific\\nAlliance (MESA) to understand the feasibility and potential impact of screening for asymptomatic\\nmalaria in households where a febrile case of malaria has been reported.\\nIn\\n\\nCambodia\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\nWe invested DFID Programme Partnership Agreement (PPA) funds in piloting a short message service\\n(SMS) technology in the private sector to improve referrals and integrate private patient data into the\\nNational Malaria Information System (MIS) in Cambodia, as we think lack of data from the private\\nsector will be a major obstacle to elimination.\\nWe have undertaken\\nsurveys to monitor changes in malaria epidemiology\\nbased on existing\\ninterventions to assess the conditions necessary to reduce transmission below the critical level and\\ntowards elimination goals in Cambodia.\\nOur elimination work in Africa has mainly focused on Ethiopia, where we conducted school-based\\nsurveys of malaria and helminth infection for development of a regional risk map with support from\\nUSAID.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nProvide focused and practical\\nchildhood illness and NTDs\\n\\nMany\\n\\nhealth\\n\\nsystems\\n\\ncapacity\\n\\nbuilding\\n\\nlinked\\n\\nto disease control,\\n\\nof our programmes have extensive capacity building components including:\\nDevelopment of a community health worker supervisors training manual and job aides in\\nMozambique, which have been greatly appreciated by the Ministry of Health and other\\nstakeholders\\nTraining in management\\n\\nof severe malaria\\n\\nin Nigeria\\n\\nDevelopment of training materials for ICCM+ in South Sudan\\nDifferential diagnosis of fever and interpersonal communication skill training, a comprehensive\\ntraining package \\xe2\\x80\\x94both for district and health facility staff through the Stop Malaria Project in\\nUganda\\n\\nSeasonal Malaria Chemoprevention\\ntraining in Katsina, northern Nigeria \\xe2\\x80\\x94a comprehensive\\ntraining package for those implementing the project\\nDevelopment of a global training manual for WHO on management of malaria programmes\\nWe are increasingly including costing exercises into our health service delivery projects which are\\naimed to test feasibility and improve delivery systems.\\nFor instance, our BMGF-funded inSCALE\\nproject in Uganda and Mozambique has now completed costing data collection, and we have included\\ncosting of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in our work in northern Nigeria.\\n\\nOther health systems strengthening work in this year includes extensive local advocacy to assure\\nsustainability of our ICCM efforts, when our projects close and further work on understanding how to\\nimprove supervision.\\nWith support from Comic Relief we are contributing to the reduction of deaths in children due to\\nmalaria and other severe childhood illnesses through strengthening\\nthe health system in Mbale\\nDistrict in Uganda.\\n\\n4. Spearhead innovative\\n\\napproaches for monitoring, evaluation and surveillance systems, and\\nundertake high quality operational research\\n~\\nOur major long-term research programme, called 'Beyond Garki', has continued. Garki is a town\\nin Northern Nigeria which was the focus of earlier longitudinal\\nresearch in the 1970s on the\\nimpact of intensive control on interrupting transmission of malaria to see if elimination was\\nfeasible. 'Beyond Garki' takes us beyond these findings and is aimed at obtaining a deeper\\nunderstanding\\nof factors influencing malaria, in light of the different epidemiological settings,\\nclimatic effects and the control efforts in areas where we work. The project is now fully\\ndeveloped in Uganda, Ethiopia and Cambodia using DFID Programme Partnership Agreement\\n(PPA) funds.\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\nWith our strategic funding we are exploring how cross-border surveillance can be adapted and\\nbetter targeted to the difficult to reach populations and, accordingly, whether it should be\\ncontinued and scaled up further in Southeast Asia.\\nWe supported a large scale malaria survey in Cambodia, which is the fourth in a unique ten year\\nseries which we designed. We are now looking at trends across the surveys.\\nAn important focus of our work in Myanmar has been on developing options to improve the\\nsurveillance system as a basis for intensified targeted malaria control.\\nIn Ethiopia we have been looking at malaria risk using serological indicators.\\nWithin some of our Africa projects we are exploring new technologies for data management\\nfrom surveys.\\nSome of our research in Africa has explored rational use of antibiotics by community health\\nworkers in Zambia, adherence to blister packs in Uganda, efficacy of malaria drugs in pregnancy\\nin Nigeria and several other implementation\\nresearch projects.\\nAs part of the research undertaken in our inSCALE project, we conducted a process evaluation\\n(PE), which was extremely useful, and we shall be looking at how to make wider use of this type\\nof activity. Most significant change stories were collected as part of the PE and discussion\\ngroups were organised with implementing staff, district leaders and national ICCM stakeholders,\\nto select the stories which reflect most significant change to the village health teams and\\ncommunity members. The evaluation of the interventions\\nin Uganda and Mozambique\\nis\\nthan\\n7000\\ninterviews\\nunderway with more\\nplanned with households, village health teams and\\nhealth facility supervisors, and highlights the importance of understanding country context and\\nstructures in depth and early on for successful design and effectiveness of complex health\\nsystem interventions.\\nWe completed the participatory evaluation of ICCM implementation in three countries \\xe2\\x80\\x94South\\nSudan, Uganda and Zambia. This research provides unique data of the experience of\\nimplementing ICCM at scale from the perspective of stakeholders at all levels \\xe2\\x80\\x94from central to\\ncommunity. This was funded by PPA and the findings are being prepared for publication. Our\\nRAcE Nigeria project is part of a unique multi-country\\noperational research study comparing\\ndifferent supervision models for ICCM.\\nMalaria Consortium played a key role in a multi-agency review of results from Integrated\\nCommunity Case Management (ICCM) in several countries including the four where we had\\nCIDA support.\\nThe symposium where results were presented concluded that integrated case\\nmanagement of common childhood illnesses can save lives and improve quality of care, but\\nmade it very clear that interventions must be operating fully at scale for enough time before\\nimpact is measured to avoid misleading conclusions. Malaria Consortium was the thematic lead\\nfor supervision, training and quality assurance, participating in a comprehensive review of\\ncurrent knowledge and available tools in this area and developing a lessons learned document.\\nDetails of the symposium including presentations and documents gathered can be found at\\nwww. lCCMs m osium. or\\nAs part of Networks (USAID funded 5-year vector control technical advice programme) we have\\nlearned much more about mosquito net distribution models and net use, including from a rapid\\nassessment of net preference in Myanmar.\\nOur first year assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a newly recommended intervention\\nfor the Sahel region of Africa, Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention\\nwith support from Bill Ik\\nMelinda Gates Foundation and DFID has provided highly encouraging results with unexpectedly\\nhigh uptake.\\n\\nlandscape analysis report on new and promising devices to diagnose mild and severe\\nsymptoms of pneumonia was completed and will be used as the foundation for selecting 6\\ndevices to be tested for accuracy in the hands of CHWs in four countries (Cambodia, Ethiopia,\\nUganda and South Sudan). Qualitative research in these four countries was completed to\\npreferences and attitudes on diagnosing pneumonia in the\\nunderstand\\nCHW challenges,\\ncommunity.\\nA\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\n5. Communicate new learning and successes for continuous programmeimprovement\\nMalaria Consortium has engaged in a wide range of communications\\nactivities in support of this\\nobjective. Many of these have been supported by the DFID PPA grant:\\n~\\nAs part of our International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) activities, we launched a project\\ndatabase detailing individual projects, as well as our funding and funding sources, on our\\nwebsite.\\nDuring the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting, held in Bangkok in December 2013,\\nMalaria Consortium hosted a symposium on resistance and elimination in the region, entitled\\n'Taking the resistance out of elimination'.\\nFollowing the symposium,\\na series of video\\npresentations highlighting key learning and evidence were produced and widely disseminated to\\nkey partners and other stakeholders worldwide.\\nAs part of activities to highlight specific areas of our technical expertise, we launched 2 new 'In\\nfocus' sections on our website. The SuNMaP section highlights our work on malaria control in\\nNigeria. On World Health Day a Beyond Garki section was launched and aims to share key\\nresources, news and learning around our work on understanding\\nchanges in malaria\\n\\nepidemiology.\\nSix new learning papers were produced and disseminated to key stakeholders at events and on\\nmultiple online platforms, including integrating severe acute malnutrition in ICCM and Moving\\ntowards malaria elimination in Asia.\\nWe signed up to two campaigns - Generation Nutrition which called for prioritisation of the fight\\nagainst acute malnutrition\\nand Fight the Fakes, a multi-stakeholder\\ncampaign to raise\\nawareness about the dangers and the impact of fake medicines. We also joined the UK Malaria\\nAdvocates, a new informal malaria focused advocacy group.\\nAs part of a number of activities to mark our 10th Anniversary, an event was held in London on\\nFebruary 25th, to share evidence and learning from a decade of working in communicable\\ndisease and child health. Key speakers and guests took part in 3 panel discussions and the event\\nwas five streamed. A 10th Anniversary publication was also produced.\\nA number of other staff took part in external discussions and debates around malaria on the\\nGuardian Professional Development Network website. Dr Prudence Hamade participated in a\\nlive online debate on antimalarial\\ndrug resistance. Helen Counihan participated in an online\\ndebate on the role and future of ICCM.\\nA number of technical presentations were filmed during our 2014 Malaria Consortium Progress\\nSymposium in Asia, March 2014 (Phnom Penh, Cambodia).\\nWe gave oral evidence to the International Development Committee inquiry in December on\\nMyanmar.\\nA presentation on our ICCM work in Zambia was given during the Zambia UK Health Workforce\\nAlliance Conference in London.\\n\\n6. Invest in institutional strengthening\\n\\nto ensure financial sustainability and maintain its position as\\nan international high quality technicol organisation\\nDuring the year a number of investments were made for institutionalstrengthening:\\n~\\nA new Development Director was appointed with Dr James Tibenderana transitioning from his\\nrole as Africa Technical Director.\\n~\\nOur in-house business development team worked extensively on the bid for Seasonal Malaria\\nChemoprevention in the Sahel.\\n~\\nA wider cadre of Trustees were successfully recruited and inducted.\\n~\\nA Malaria Consortium\\nUS Representative\\nwas appointed to engage with key donors and\\nimplementing partners and participate in discussions relevant to the development of the Sector\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n~\\n\\n~\\n\\nWe upgraded our financial accounting software and transition of our financial reporting to\\nMicrosoft Reporting Services to improve efficiencies in reporting times and availability of\\nfinancial information.\\nA number of policies across the organisation were updated and new policies were introduced\\nfor Warehouse and stock management and telecommunications. Controls were strengthened\\nthrough\\nthe revision of Finance, Procurement\\nand Travel policies, whilst additional\\norganisational-wide\\npolicies on conflict of interest and anti- money laundering were added to\\nethical considerations, fraud and anti-corruption and anti-bribery polices. All new and revised\\npolicies came into force from April 1, 2014.\\n\\nFinancial Review\\n\\nIncoming Resources\\n\\nTotal income received during the year amounted to f54. 5m an increase of f23.3 million (75/0) on\\nthe previous year including Gifts in Kind and an increase of f0.5 million (190) excluding Gifts in Kind.\\nMalaria Consortium, as in previous years, continues to receive the majority of its funding from\\ninstitutional\\ndonors, including the British Government\\nand the US Government.\\nThe UK\\ngovernment agency Department for International Development (DFID) contributed 2190 of our\\ntotal income. The US government agency \\xe2\\x80\\x94USAID, directly and via sub-agreements including Johns\\nHopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and FHI360 contributed 1790 of the total income. The\\nGlobal Fund (via sub-agreements)\\ncontributed 59'0 of our total income with other donors\\ncontributing the balance. Please refer to Note 2c on page 21 for the full list of our donors.\\ninclude f22/um for nets procured through\\nGlobal Fund's Voluntary\\nPooled\\nprocurement mechanism for distribution in a Universal Long Lasting Insecticide Net Coverage\\nProgramme in Uganda. The programme is run on behalf of the Government of Uganda and in\\ncoordination with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\nGifts\\n\\nin\\n\\nKind\\n\\nResources Expended\\nCharitable expenditure on programmes increased by f24.4m to f55.1m; note 3 on page 22 shows\\nthis expenditure categorised according to five objectives. Prevention and case management is our\\nbiggest areas of work representing 7890 of the total programme expenditure for the year. 5990 of\\nprogramme expenditure occurred in Uganda and a further 2190 in Nigeria. Support costs as a\\nproportion of direct costs decreased compared to the prior year (4/o compared to 990 last year). In\\ncarrying out its programmes Malaria Consortium works with a number of partners to which it sub\\ncontracts its work. Total sub-contract expenditure during the year was f0.3m.\\n\\nResult for the year\\nThe total net movement in funds for the year was a decrease of f 0.6m compared to an increase of\\nf0.5m in the prior year. At the end of the year restricted funds for on-going projects were f0.04m\\nand unrestricted funds were f5.0m.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\nReserves Policy\\nThe majority of the organisation's operational commitments are related to activities funded by\\nrestricted funds. The contractual agreements cover the completion of such tasks and related\\nfinancial commitments.\\nThe Board of Trustees recognise the importance\\nof building and\\nmaintaining unrestricted reserves at an appropriate level and entrust the Finance, Audit and Risk\\nCommittee to annually assess the charity's level of unrestricted funds. On their recommendation,\\nthe Board of Trustees agree that the required range of the reserve is E3.0m to f3.4m, equivalent to\\napproximately six months of operational costs which would give the organisation flexibility to cover\\ntemporary timing differences for grant claims, adequate working capital for core costs and would\\nallow the organisation to respond to emergencies quickly if required. At 31 March 2014, free\\nreserves stood at f3.9m, which is unrestricted funds of ES.Om, of which EO. Sm is designated, less\\nE0.6m represented by fixed assets. During the year the Board of Trustees designated f0.4m of\\nunrestricted reserves for strategic investment to continue funding work in integrated community\\ncase management in Uganda. The Board of Trustees will consider further designations of reserves\\nin the forthcoming year.\\n\\nInvestment\\n\\nPolicy and Performance\\n\\nThe nature of the activities of the charity is such that unforeseen calls can be made on its resources\\nat short notice when new opportunities arise. Accordingly, the bulk of the charity's liquid reserves\\nare held for the time being in interest bearing accounts that can be called on without notice.\\nMonies will be kept in the most likely currency of use, if there is a significant contingency to that\\nuse, then that will be reflected in the currency on which the money is held. The charity will not\\nspeculate on currency, but hedge against potential losses based on the cash flow requirements.\\n\\nPlans for Future Periods\\nMalaria Consortium will continue to have a primary focus\\nin selected related health areas, in particular, pneumonia,\\nhealth systems strengthening\\nand where appropriate\\nmanagement (ICCM) also in maternal and neonatal health\\n\\nWe will further develop our strategy and contribution\\n\\n1.\\n\\non malaria whilst expanding our portfolio\\nneglected tropical diseases, child health,\\nas part of integrated community case\\nand nutrition.\\n\\nto:\\n\\nResearch, focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on implementation\\nimplementation programmes we support\\n\\nresearch built on\\n\\n2.

The Risk Assessment and Risk\\nManagement processes are reviewed quarterly by the committee and updated. The major risks, to\\nwhich the charity is exposed, as identified by the Trustees, are reviewed and processes have been\\nestablished to manage those risks. The Finance, Audit and Risk Committee have prepared a Risk\\nAssessment Register (RAR) that shows the impact and probability of the major risks; this is updated\\nand reported annually to the Board by the Committee and senior management. During the year the\\ninternal auditors carried out a review of the risk policy, process and procedures in the organisation.\\n\\nRisk Assessment\\n\\nThe achievement of our objectives depends on many factors, both inside and outside the control of\\nthe organisation. The identified risks, and our approach to their management, include:\\n\\nfor resources driven by: increased\\npressure on international aid budgets; individual calls for proposal for funding becoming less\\nlinked to specific diseases or conditions, more linked to wider health system support and\\nincreasingly competitively bid; the subsequent increase in interest from organisations with a\\nless focused portfolio of activities; and the appropriate demand to ensure that solutions are\\nsustainable for the communities that we serve and transferred to them. To mitigate these\\nMalaria Consortium is working with a wider combination of\\nchallenges to sustainability,\\ninternational partners, testing the effectiveness of working across multiple disease conditions\\nat risk of Malaria, increasing the number and scale of implementation\\nin the communities\\nprogrammes undertaken to combine with our operational research activities, building on our\\nbusiness development capacity and transitioning to operate more often as the primary\\nrecipient of funding, as opposed to being generally 'sub-recipient' under the auspices of other\\norganisations.\\n\\n1. Strategic: There continues to be increased competition\\n\\n2. Governonce: Any organisation governed by a Board of Trustees is put at greater risk if it does\\nnot have the right combination of skills among the Trustees that reflect the diversity of the\\nits work and its clients, to effectively guide and monitor the strategic\\norganisation,\\ndevelopment of the organisation. A review of governance of the organisation included the\\nprocess of recruitment of trustees. This process is complete and additional Trustees were\\nrecruited to the Board. The Board now includes 14 trustees from a more diverse background\\nthan previously bringing expertise in many different fields. The Internal auditors carried out a\\nreview of our compliance in operating internationally and we will build on their findings to\\nstrengthen governance across the organisation.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\n3. Performance:\\n\\nThe programmatic achievements of the organisation remain impressive with\\nrepeated, and increased, funding from donors.\\nIn addition,\\nthe requirements\\nfor\\naccountability, transparency and assurance to enable the organisation to demonstrate good\\nvalue for money for donors have solidified. The project performance assessment system was\\nrefined and is used to monitor the implementation, technical quality and financial spend on all\\nprojects. Operational calls between Senior Management in the Head Office and in the\\nRegional Offices were implemented\\nand continue to review performance and spend on a\\nmonthly basis.\\n\\n4. Operational: We continue to operate\\n\\nin some areas with a high, and changing, security risk but\\nthese are also where those who suffer from the highest burden of malaria and communicable\\ndiseases are found. Security of personnel and property is paramount for management teams\\nat all levels. We ensure we keep up-to-date information about the security situations where\\nwe work, and have suitable insurance to cover our work and staff. We regularly review the\\nlocations where we work and where necessary, if security risks are persistent, relocate, and/or\\nsuspend operations. During the year operations were suspended in South Sudan and all\\ninternational\\nstaff were evacuated safely. We continue to monitor closely on-going\\ndevelopments in Nigeria and Thailand in addition to South Sudan.\\n\\nS. Financial: Continued growth, and any requirement for post, rather than pre, financing of\\nprojects can lead to challenges of maintaining the quality of delivery programmes and the\\nadequacy of cash flow to finance operations. Maintaining an appropriate level of unrestricted\\nfunding for strategic investments is a continuing risk for the organisation. Current policies, the\\nportfolio of donors and improved financial reporting systems allow the monitoring of our cash\\nflow and we work closely with the bank to minimise any currency fluctuations. With careful\\ncontrol of overhead costs we are able to maintain our reserves in line with our current reserve\\npolicy.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cMalaria Consortium\\n\\nStatement of Trustees' responsibilities\\nfinancial statements\\n\\nin\\n\\nrespect of the trustees' annual report and the\\n\\nThe trustees are responsible for preparing the Trustees' Annual Report, which constitutes the Strategic\\nReport and the Trustees' Report, and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and\\nregulations.\\nCompany law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year.

The accounts comply\\nwith the Companies Act\\n\\n2006.\\n\\nThe going concern basis has been adopted ln preparing the financial statements as tliere is reasonable expectatlon that the charity has adequate\\nresources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future.\\nThe financial review ln the Trustees Report reviews the Bnances of the chanty for the year ended 31 March 2014 In comparison to the prior year. The\\ncharity has a healthy cash balance and a large proportion of grant funding required for 2014/15 and 2016/16 contracted with donors. The Trustees\\nreport explains how the charity is structured and managed and how major risks are dealt with. The Board has a reasonable expectation that the\\ncharity has adequate resources to continue for the foreseable future. Thus the Board of Trustees continue to adapt the going concern basis of\\n\\naccounting in preparing the financial\\nb\\n\\nstatements.\\n\\nFunds Accounting\\n\\nUnrestdcted\\n\\nfunds are general funds that are avagable at the trustees' discretion for use in furtherance\\n\\nDesignated funds represent unrestricted\\n\\nfunds that have been\\n\\nRestricted funds are those provided by donors for use\\npurpose.\\n\\nc\\n\\nIn\\n\\nof the objectives of the charity.\\n\\nset aside by the trustees for particular purposes\\n\\na particular area or for specihc purposes, the use of which is restricted to that area or\\n\\nIncoming Resources\\nIncoming resources given fora specific purpose are credited to a restricted fund.\\n\\nIncoming resources becoming available to the charity are recognised in the Statement of Financial Activities on the basis of entitlement. In respect\\nof Income not tied to timegmited grants, income Is recognised as soon as it is prudent and practicable to do so. In the case of performance reiated\\nis considered to be conditional upon degvery of the specified level of service, in accordance\\ngrants or long term contract income, Income entitlement\\nwith FRSS and the Chanties SORp. Income Is therefore recognised to the extent the charity has delivered the service or actiwty, with the grants less\\nthe management fee being credited to restricted income in the SOFA The expenditure incurred to date is used as a reasonable estimate or\\napproximation of the charity's performance and so income entitlement. Any such income not recognised in the year will be carried forward as\\ndeferred income and Is included in liabgitles in the balance sheet.\\nAB\\n\\nDuring the year, a review was undertaken of the analysis between accrued and deferred Income, aligning the dlsdosure more closely to payment\\nterms. This has resulted ln an increase in current Rabglties (deferred Income) for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 61,773,000 and a corresponding\\nIncrease in debtors (accrued Income). There was no impact on net assets or on the surplus for the year.\\n\\nresources expended, when the items are used/distributed. Where\\nthe gift is an asset, the asset is capitagsed and depreciated.
