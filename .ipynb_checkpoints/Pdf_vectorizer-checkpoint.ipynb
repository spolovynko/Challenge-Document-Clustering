As Chair of Finance, his extraordinary ability to combine mischievous asides with a gimlet eye for detail and consequences was a remarkable force for stability and progress. Above all, Martin cared - he cared for the school, he cared deeply for the young people we are here to help, and he cared for the families who fight so hard to do the best for their children. Knowing him and working with him was a privilege and a delight. Martin was a great man, and our sympathy goes out to Eliza Mays-Smith, fellow governor and another friend to all at Mary Hare.  \\\\x cI  MARY HARE  REFERENCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS OF THE CHARITY, ITS TRUSTEES AND ADVISERS FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   Governors, Directors and Charity Trustees M S D Granatt CB, (Chairman) A D Barron G M Bevan Thomas (resigned   March  ) V P Bragg (appointed   June  ) R W Clement (appointed   March  ) H Cole, (West Berkshire Council Representative) A J Emerson (appointed   March  ) R Evans S Goldberg, (Alumni Representative) J C Hedger CB, (Vice Chairman) S Lindley (appointed   March  ) K L Loyd (appointed   March  ) Lady Eliza Mays-Smith R M Mays-Smith (deceased   April  ) A N R McAlpine J E Roberts (resigned   July  ) R A G Sanders Rose OBE J P Sharpe D A J Shaw P A Simpson A J Strivens (appointed   March  ) N M Thomas Company Registered Number   Charity Registered Number   Address and Registered Office Arlington Manor, Snelsmore Common, Newbury, Berkshire, RG   BQ Principal P R Gale Company Secretary and Director of Finance and Business J P Jackson Independent Auditor James Cowper LLP, Mill House, Overbridge Square, Hambridge Lane, Newbury, Berkshire, RG   UX Bankers National Westminster Bank PLC,   Market Place, Newbury, Berkshire, RG   AJ Solicitors Pinsent Masons,   Crown Place, Earl Street, London, EC A  ES  Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   The Governors submit their report and the audited accounts for the year ended   July   prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Statement of Recommended Practice \"Accounting and Reporting by Charities\" issued in March  .

As well as providing for a variety of award bearing courses, it runs a wide range of day courses and conferences.  Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   The Burwood Centre The Centre provides independent assessments for babies and children diagnosed with a hearing loss. The Centre\\\\\\'s income is derived from fees paid by the families for assessments, charitable donations and support from unrestricted income. Mary Hare Services Limited The company is a wholly owned trading subsidiary of Mary Hare carrying out commercial activities to raise funds for Mary Hare. Activities include rental of facilities including the Arlington Arts Centre, and the use of the Mill Hall building for conducting weddings. It is not a registered charity. It draws up accounts to   July each year. Arlington Laboratories Limited Mary Hare has a  % interest in this company. The company\\\\\\'s investment takes the form of a share capital investment of \\\\xc \\\\xa , . The company manufactures and sells earmoulds on a commercial basis, mainly supplying NHS Trusts, and makes up accounts to   December each year. The accounts reflect Mary Hare\\\\\\'s share of the retained profit, assets and liabilities of Arlington Laboratories for the period   July   to   June  . The Mary Hare Foundation The Mary Hare Foundation is a charity established under a trust deed in  . The purpose of the Foundation is to raise significant funding for major capital and other projects undertaken by Mary Hare. Its main project in the year was the Murray House Appeal to raise funds for the building of a new boarding house. OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES Objects i  The objects of Mary Hare are to promote and provide for the advancement of education of children and young adults with hearing and related disabilities, including through the operation of boarding schools and other educational activities. i Aims ! Mary Hare\\\\\\'s aim is to enable deaf children to fulfil their academic potential. It also aims to develop its services to improve delivery of benefits to deaf children, both directly through education and through the training of professionals and practitioners working with deaf children. Children\\\\\\'s needs are met by provision of special education services and by developing education skills which can be passed on through training. Emphasis is also placed on meeting pupils\\\\\\' social and emotional needs. Objectives The objectives for  -  were: \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa  Continue to deliver outstanding academic outcomes for deaf students. \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa  To get the best possible OFSTED judgement and report. \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa  Develop our vocational provision on offer within the   to   curriculum. \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa  To increase pupil numbers on both school sites. \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa  To develop a challenging Five Year Strategy. \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa  To recruit a new Principal.  Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   Principal Activities The principal activity of Mary Hare is to provide education, through two schools, for deaf children. Both schools educate using an auditory oral method. Pupils come from a range of communication backgrounds, including total communication, sign bilingual and auditory/oral. Mary Hare Primary School is a non-maintained special school which caters for primary-aged children (  -  years of age) with moderate, severe or profound hearing loss. During the year the Primary School had an average of   pupils. Mary Hare Secondary School is a non-maintained, national special school for deaf children. Pupils come from all over the UK with some from overseas. They are aged between   and   years. During the year the secondary school had an average of   pupils. Mary Hare\\\\\\'s Training Services Division trains teachers of the deaf through postgraduate courses provided in association with Oxford Brookes University. Due to the changes in the funding for higher education, Brookes University decided to cease its contract with Mary Hare School from September   onwards, because the training of teachers of the deaf is no longer aligned with its future research plans. On the  rd of September  , Mary Hare signed a contract with Hertfordshire University enabling it to switch seamlessly to an alternative higher education provider with an excellent reputation in this sector. Commercial activities carried out in Mary Hare Services Ltd include the letting of school facilities for an international language school and for weddings; and the letting of the Arlington Arts Centre for commercial theatre, conferences and other events. Income from all Mary Hare\\\\\\'s commercial activities provides the school with funds equivalent to the cost of approximately nine teaching posts. STRATEGIC REPORT Summary  . Mary Hare School was inspected by OFSTED in January   and was again awarded the status of \\\\\\'Outstanding\\\\\\'. We are particularly proud to have received this endorsement at a time when so much is being said about \\\\\\'raising the bar\\\\\\'.  . Pupil numbers in both our Primary centre and at the secondary school are strong, with high levels of interest from families. Our continued focus on marketing and particularly on events held for prospective families, continue to have an impact. We ended the year with   pupils.  . The commercial activities which support the work of the school continue to perform well. Our Earmould laboratory traded robustly in the year whilst our Hearing Centre in Newbury experienced higher still levels of activity. While relatively small, the Hearing Aid Repair Shop is seeing strong growth. Arlington Arts is a successful and well established local arts venue which also has extremely consistent bookings for conferences, seminars and workshops.  . Our Training and Courses Department, unique as an arm of a charity with a school at its heart, continues to be a major provider of courses and training for teachers of the Deaf and Hearing Aid dispensers.  . After   years outstanding service, including eight as Chief Executive and Principal, Tony Shaw retired in August  . He has been succeeded by Peter Gale, previously Vice Principal. Achievements and Performance The school achieved an A Level pass rate of  %, in line with the average for normal hearing students. At GCSE we had pupils achieving strongly with our top pupil achieving   GCSE\\\\\\'s at an average grade A.  Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   OFSTED came in January   and once again graded the school as Outstanding. Courses in Animal Care, Dog Grooming, Painting and Decorating, Forestry and Chainsaw management were all successfully introduced, drawing upon our model of using the skills of staff within our own organisation to support our students. The staff asked to work in this way have been flexible, dedicated and successful. Pupil recruitment strategies have included more specialist events targeting families and young people at specific stages and these events have been very successful. We have also increased our activities around pupil retention, especially at  . Pupil numbers at the end of the school year in July   were  , the highest since July  . School Leadership team and governors worked on a Five Year Strategy which was finalised in March  . The strategic goals, now being turned into actions and outcomes, are described below. After a thorough recruitment process, supported by leading search consultants, Peter Gale was appointed as Principal and takes up his post in September  . We continue to upgrade, redevelop and replace some of our main campus infrastructure, concentrating on pupil accommodation. The opening of Murray House for Year   pupils has already enabled necessary structural improvements in other boarding houses to progress. Financial Review An analysis of Mary Hare\\\\\\'s results by activity is as follows:   \\\\xc \\\\xa  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )     ( )       ( ) ( ) ( )  Mary Hare School Mary Hare Primary Burwood Centre i  Trading Activities Joint venture activities Exceptional item - donations for Murray House Exceptional item - profit on sale of Mews Cottage j Actuarial loss on defined benefit pension scheme Exceptional item - pension Total    \\\\xc \\\\xa  ( )   ( ) ( )     ( )  ,    ( ) ( )    It will be apparent from the table above that the results for the year materially benefit from the sale of Mews Cottage. In the year a net profit of \\\\xc \\\\xa k was received from the sale of the unused property adjacent to the Mill Hall, the site of the Primary School. A further \\\\xc \\\\xa k was received from the Mary Hare Foundation for Murray House, our year   Boarding House bringing the total funding for the project to \\\\xc \\\\xa , k by year-end. The accounts are also impacted by pension scheme adjustments arising from a revaluation of Mary Hare\\\\\\'s share in the Berkshire Pension Scheme by Pension Actuaries. Changes in assumptions which the Actuaries have made have given rise to a loss of \\\\xc \\\\xa k compared with a loss last year of \\\\xc \\\\xa k. There are further pension scheme costs of \\\\xc \\\\xa k due to the excess of current service costs less employer contributions and costs of \\\\xc \\\\xa k due to the gap between the interest on the pension liability and the expected return on the scheme. None of these losses or gains give rise to a cash benefit or cost to Mary Hare in the current year. If one considers the results before these pension and exceptional adjustments, Mary Hare School itself continues to run at a loss for the year, albeit showing a continued improvement on prior years. The statement also shows the extent to which the trading activities which Mary Hare conducts both on its own behalf and in conjunction with its partners support the School and in part mitigate the loss. We continue to enjoy the benefit of support from the Mary Hare Foundation which further enhances our ability to offer value for money.  Page   i  \\\\x cMARY HARE  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   The major initiative in pupil recruitment over the past two years saw a marked upturn in Secondary School pupil numbers with numbers returning to   after the slight declines in recent years. The Primary School is maintaining its year on year pupil growth seen in recent years and ended the year with   pupils. Local Authority funding however remains tight which means continued pressure on placement numbers and Mary Hare fee levels. In the year, Mary Hare commenced a major programme of necessary refurbishment centering on the first part of a major electrical works programme. These works will continue into  - . In addition Mary Hare experienced high inflation in core costs such as food and other supplies and we have had to continue with our rigorous cost control of recent years. These joint pressures on revenue and costs have happened at the same time as funding for Non Maintained Special Schools has been overhauled by the Government. Although the changes were and remain relatively complex to comply with, these have been implemented successfully by working carefully with Local Authorities. Plans for Future Periods Governors and School Leaders worked together in the Spring of   to consult with staff and then produce a Five Year Strategy Document. The Strategic Goals are:  . Exceptional education and care lead by an exceptional staff.  . An excellent environment for working, learning and living.  . Leavers who are well prepared for life after Mary Hare.  . Secure income/resources.  . Leadership, management structures and processes which facilitate excellence and embrace change.  . A powerful Mary Hare brand. The Leadership Team are currently embedding these Goals into the School Development Plan and defining the actions which will secure the goals. Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Governors examine the major risks that Mary Hare faces regularly. There are systems to monitor and control these risks to mitigate any impact they may have on Mary Hare in the future. The Governors are satisfied that adequate systems are in place. The current external economic environment of course affects the school directly. We are aware of the pressures on local authorities and we are attempting to adjust our fee levels accordingly. We are also aware of the impact of a potential weakening of demand in our commercial activities. The Governors consistently monitor the forecasts of the organisation and cost reduction plans are implemented as necessary. Reserves and Reserves Policy Mary Hare has unrestricted reserves of \\\\xc \\\\xa , k at the year end ( : \\\\xc \\\\xa ,  k). Unrestricted reserves have again been significantly affected this year by the deficit arising from the accounting rules surrounding the Royal County of Berkshire Pension Fund. The Governors continue to monitor the Royal County of Berkshire Pension Scheme deficit. Under the relevant accounting rules, the deficit of \\\\xc \\\\xa , k at   July   has been included in the balance sheet. We do not anticipate a significant impact on the cashflow of this deficit in the foreseeable future. The level of current contributions follow the requirements of the Scheme based on the recommendation of its actuarial advisers and considerable notice is expected (and in the past been given) of any change in recommendations from the Scheme advisers to address any ongoing deficits. Further details can be found in note   to the accounts. Group cash reserves were \\\\xc \\\\xa k at the year end ( : \\\\xc \\\\xa k) and are monitored closely to: a) achieve a margin of working capital sufficient to enable all aspects of Mary Hare\\\\\\'s activities to be conducted efficiently b) provide cover for significant unexpected or unavoidable increases in outgoing resources or reductions in incoming resources. Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE REPORT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   Public Benefit In setting our objectives and planning our activities, we have given careful consideration to the Charity Commissjon\\\\\\'s general guidance on public benefit and in particular to its supplementary public benefit guidance on advancing education and on fee-charging. Mary Hare provides education to its pupils within the national curriculum and meets the standards set by Ofsted. This meets a fundamental test for advancement of education for public benefit identified by the Charity Commission. The education is restricted to pupils who are moderately, severely or profoundly deaf. This class of beneficiaries have a particular common charitable need which justifies restricting the benefit to them because of the special nature of the education required. Environmental Initiatives Mary Hare continues to undertake a series of environmental initiatives. Mary Hare continues to look at a wide range of projects to reduce energy consumption. In the new Murray House year   boarding accommodation, modern efficient light fittings and sensors have been installed and the building is partly heated by solar panels. Accounting Responsibilities Company law requires the Governors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including the income and expenditure, of the group for that period. In preparing these accounts, the Governors are required to: \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   select;suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   ensure applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts;  \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company will continue in operation.  The Governors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act  . They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Statement of Disclosure So far as the Governors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company\\\\\\'s auditors are unaware. Auditor The auditors, James Cowper LLP, will be proposed for reappointment in accordance with Section   of the Companies Act  . This report, which includes the Group strategic report, was approved by the Governors on   October   and signed on their behalf by:  M S D Granatt Chairman  Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\\\\\\'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MARY HARE We have audited the financial statements of Mary Hare for the year ended   July   set out on pages   to  . The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and its members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinion we have formed. ; RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOVERNORS AND AUDITOR As explained more fully in the Governors\\\\\\' responsibilities statement, the Governors (who are also the directors of the charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board\\\\\\'s Ethical Standards for Auditors. SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council\\\\\\'s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In our opinion the financial statements: \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   give a true and fair view of the state of the group\\\\\\'s and the parent charitable company\\\\\\'s affairs as at   July   and of the group\\\\\\'s incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended;  \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  \\\\xe \\\\x \\\\xa   have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act  .

The schemes are accounted for differently as the assets and liabilities of the RCBPS scheme can be separately identified as belonging to Mary Hare. This is not the case for the TPS scheme and only summary information for the scheme as a whole is provided.  Page    \\\\x cMARY HARE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED   JULY   The Teachers\\\\\\' Pension Scheme This is a multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme and it is not possible or appropriate to identify the assets and liabilities of the TPS which are attributable to Mary Hare. As required by Reporting Standard   \\\\\\'Retirement Benefits\\\\\\', Mary Hare accounts for this scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. On   July   the Chief Secretary to the Treasury confirmed that the Government will be taking forward legislation based on the reformed scheme design for the Teachers\\\\\\' Pension Scheme to be introduced in   as set out in the Teachers\\\\\\' Pension Scheme - Proposed Final Agreement (the TPS Agreement). The TPS Agreement sets out the main parameters for both the provision of future pension benefits and the structuring of the future contributions to the TPS including the basis for increasing average employee contribution rates up to  . Under the TPS Agreement, employer contribution rates from   April   are continuing at  . % with employee rates varying between  . % and  . %. For subsequent years data and information is being collated to inform a Government review of the tiering structures in advance of the Department for Education consulting on contribution increases for  /  onwards. The Government have set a gross cost ceiling for the main public service pension schemes of  . % with a net cost ceiling of  . % and an average employee contribution of  . %. The Government Actuary\\\\\\'s Department has in a report dated   March   concluded that the TPS Agreement scheme design is within this required cost ceiling. This conclusion is dependent on and sensitive to the data, methodology and assumptions adopted and further details on these are available in the full Government Actuary\\\\\\'s report which is available on the Department for Education website.
