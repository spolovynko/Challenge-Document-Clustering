# Clustering documents using TF-IDF

- Type of challenge: Learning
- Duration: `1 week`
- Deadline : `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`
- Team challenge: Individual project

## Mission objectives

- Implementation of natural language processing techniques.
- Implementation of unsupervised learning.
- Understand the advantages and limitations of different clustering algorithms.

## The Mission

Well done, you are mastering machine learning and natural language processing. Now, it's time to move forward, this time working on a challenge related to unsupervised learning (clustering).

The client needs to read and verify thousands of documents per month, and they are building a solution to automate the process.

Currently, the workflow of the company for automating the process is as follows:

1. The company receives a batch of digital documents, mainly invoices emitted from several companies.
2. Each invoice is processed with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system
3. The desired information is extracted from the document.

   However, things can go wrong during the OCR processing and the text extraction has to be done manually. Aiming for full automation, the company wants to take advantage of the manual intervention to also "label" the documents according to their content to further train a model able to classify them into several groups, including the outliers which need manual text extraction.

   You are a new developer in the company and your mission is to use clustering techniques to classify the documents and reduce the manual work. Once your project is completed, the company will have the following improved workflow:

4. The software classifies and labels the documents according to their content.
5. Documents labeled as "outliers" are sent for manual classification.
6. Thanks to your work the company has developed better software.

### Must-have features

- Quantify the relevance of terms contained on a document.
- Evaluate different clustering algorithms to classify the documents according to their content.
- Validate the results and find an explanation to define the clusters created.
- The program should be able to work for any set of documents.

### Miscellaneous information

There are different datasets that you could explore for testing your code. Some of these datasets are very large (12+ GB). You don't need the whole dataset:

- [Kleister Charity Data](https://github.com/applicaai/kleister-charity)

Useful techniques to quantify the relevance of a term in a document:

- TF-IDF
- Bag of Words
- Cosine similarity

### Constraints

- Create **functions**, do **not** create a single huge script.
- Each **function** has to be typed.
- Your code should be **commented**.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.

## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. **Small presentation (5 minutes) showing of your work**
3. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - ⚠️ **DATA SOURCES**
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)

## Evaluation criteria

### Technical

- Publish clean and readable code on GitHub.
- README has the format specified in the #Deliverables section.
- Different algorithms for clustering were explored.
- Comparison between algorithms was done and explained.
- Document contents were correctly classified.

### Soft-skills

- Communication with the client was prioritized to understand his needs.
- Project steps were enumerated and tasks were dispatched.
- Time available was managed well.
- Each member of the team worked towards project completeness.
- Constant communication within the team was achieved.

### Final presentation

- Slides are not too cluttered.
- The text on the slides is not read out loud.
- Presentation is tailored to the audience.
- Every group member understood each part of the project.
- Body language and intonation were professional.
